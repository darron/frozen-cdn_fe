Frozen CDN Frontend
============

This is the Ruby on Rails frontend to the Frozen CDN Varnish backed CDN.

All Chef cookbooks for the CDN are [available here](https://github.com/darron/frozen-cdn-cookbooks).

Over 100 million hits went through the system over 3 months of testing in production. After we discovered [Fastly](http://www.fastly.com/) we abandoned the prototype.
